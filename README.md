A small step for man, but a giant leap for Jonathan

This new undertaking marks a pivotal moment in the journey of the mind.
The rolling hills safeguard our deepest fears, and lie restless in the winter dew.
What am I but a speck on the galaxy's diving board. 
What are we but an afterthought of a life well lived.
